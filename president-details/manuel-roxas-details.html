            <p>
              Manuel Acuña Roxas served as the fifth president of the
              Philippines and the first president of the independent Third
              Philippine Republic. His presidency marked the transition from
              U.S. Commonwealth to full sovereignty, though his term was cut
              short by his untimely death.
            </p>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
              Born on January 1, 1892 in Capiz (now Roxas City) to a prominent
              political family. His parents were Gerardo Roxas and Rosario
              Acuña. He graduated as valedictorian from Manila High School and
              top of his class at the University of the Philippines College of
              Law.
            </p>

            <h3>Presidency</h3>
            <p>
              Roxas was elected in April 1946 and inaugurated on July 4, 1946,
              the day the Philippines gained full independence from the United
              States. His administration focused on postwar reconstruction and
              establishing the new republic's institutions.

              Roxas's brief presidency established important foundations for the
              new republic, though his acceptance of certain U.S. conditions for
              independence remains controversial. His death from a heart attack
              at Clark Air Base made him the second Philippine president to die
              in office.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Roxas political dynasty continues through descendants like his
              grandson, former Senator Mar Roxas. His hometown was renamed Roxas
              City in his honor, and his image appears on the 100-peso bill,
              commemorating his role in Philippine independence.
